# BuscaLIMA (minesweeper game)
In this repository we will recreate the minesweeper game using the Python programming language. 

To develop this game, we have used different Python packages.Here are the most important ones: 

|Package |Description            |Usage                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|tkinter |Tkinter is the package that is considered a standard for the graphical user interface for Python     |In this project, Tkinter fulfills the task of creating and managing the user interface|      

# Game Example
The player will have three options for the level they choose( easy, intermediate and difficult). Once the difficulty has been chosen, the interface will generate a grid where they can play.


# In case of receiving any type of error:
* Check that you've typed the commands correctly. 


* Check that you have the Tkinter packages in your Python installation.
